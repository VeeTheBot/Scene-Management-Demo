# Scene-Management-Demo
A simple 2D demo of a player moving into a door to change the scene. I wanted to help a friend who was having trouble loading scenes, so I made this in a couple hours. This project is solely to demonstrate a quick and easy way to have interactions such as this during gameplay.
